Upon signing up the user is prompted to enter more infomration about themselves for their profile, followed by entering their first recipe. The user has the ability 
to skip the process in case they choose to. When signed in, the navbar will display three options: Search, MyPotlucks and Profile.

### Search
In the Search page, the user has the ability to search for any user of on the platform and request them as a friend. The end user will have to accept their friend request 
for the user to appear as a friend. They will also be able to see their current friends, as well as their incoming friend requests. For each friend request, the user 
has the option to accept of deny the friend request. 

### MyPotlucks
Potlucks are groups of friends within which users can share one or many recipes with the other group members. The goal with this is the ability to share recipes 
with friends after a dinner party, potluck or event, so that all the attendees have access to the shared recipes. 

In the MyPotlucks window, the user will see the potlucks that they are a member of. On the right-hand side of the page is the definition of a potluck, along 
with a sentence explaining what a potluck can do for the user. When clicking on a potluck, the user will be taked to the potluck page where they will be able 
to see the shared recipes, the members, add or remove recipes that they have shared, and add new members to the potluck. 

### Profile
In the profile page the user will be able to see and edit their personal information, their profile picture, as well as view and add any more recipes they have.
